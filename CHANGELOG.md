* **core:** New ClientLib handling for js.txt

The js.txt file now requires the entry file path rather than the conventional AEM `#base` statement and file names/paths. See the below example.
```
resources/js/main.js
```

Please note that only a single entry is supported at this time with the possibility of multiple coming in the near future.
